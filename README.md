Release Criteria
Testing/QA: Before CalC is released, I would like to complete alpha and beta testing to make sure there are no bugs, database is available for every user, and the app does not crash.
Documentation: I would like to make sure that developers documents the codes religiously. I would also like to be updated on possible changes to features, either via a project management tool or email. I would like to be briefed on a bi-monthly basis, rather than simply view a finished product.
Support: I would like to ask my developer what support will be offered after the initial product is built. I will also make sure that the developer I hire will be available on standby basis (and will be compensated accordingly) for at least the first 48 hours after launch, to ensure that any unforeseen glitches will be taken care of.
