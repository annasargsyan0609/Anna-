### 1 ### 1st feature is to identify the optimal amount of calories for the person ###

age = int(input("What is your age: "))
gender = input('What is your gender: ')
weight = int(input('What is your weight: '))
height = int(input('What is your height: '))

if gender == 'male':
  c1 = 66
  hm = 6.2 * height
  wm = 12.7 * weight
  am = 6.76 * age
  bmr_result = c1 + hm + wm - am
elif gender == 'female':
  c1 = 655.1
  hm = 4.35 * height
  wm = 4.7 * weight
  am = 4.7 * age
  bmr_result = c1 + hm + wm - am
print(bmr_result)

### 2 ### Second feature is to calculate the calories the user get.

import json
food_data ='''
{
"foods": [
  {
  "food_code" : "151",
  "food_name" : "pasta",
  "calories" : "2000"
  },
{
  "food_code" : "152",
  "food_name" : "barbeque",
  "calories" : "1500"
  },
{
  "food_code" : "153",
  "food_name" : "chicken",
  "calories" : "1000"
  }

]
}'''
data = json.loads(food_data)
print(data)

food_name = input("Please insert a food name:")
for foods in data["foods"] :
  if(foods["food_name"] == (food_name)):
    food_calories = int(foods["calories"])
    break
  else:
    food_calories = 0
if food_calories > 0:
  grams = float(input("Please insert a grams of the specific food that you eat:"))
  new_calories = grams*food_calories
  print(new_calories)
else:
  print("There is no data about the food that you eat")

### 3 ####3rd feature is to calculate the difference between the optimal amount of calories and the calories that the user has alredy got.

bmr_result = int(input("Please insert yout bmr:"))
new_calories = int(input("Please insert calories that you get:"))
if (bmr_result - new_calories > 0):
  diff = bmr_result - new_calories
  print("Remains to eat" ,diff, "calories")
else:
  print("Stop eating :D ")
